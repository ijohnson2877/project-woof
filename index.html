				<h3 style="text-align: center;">Understanding the Maltese</h3> 
					<p>The Maltese is the quintessential lap dog. It is extremely lovable and playful, and enjoys nothing more than to be pampered and praised by its owner. The breed is easily distinguished by its straight and long white coat, or it can habe short scrappy hair.</p>
						<hr size="2"/>
					<p>The Maltese is a toy dog breed that has a compact and square body. It is entirely covered with silky, flat, longor curly, white hair that, if allowed to grow to full length, hangs nearly to the ground. Its expression is both alert and gentle. As a vigorous dog, the Maltese moves with a smooth, lively, and flowing gait; it may even appear as the dog is actually floating on the ground when it is trotting.</p>
